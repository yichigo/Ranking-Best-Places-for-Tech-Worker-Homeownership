Ranking Best Places for Tech Worker Homeownership


Since the Great Recession of 2008, Software Engineer salaries have exploded relative to other professions. This can be attributed to a couple of factors: the settlement of the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Case [21] and IPO of Facebook and rise of “Unicorn” (private companies worth over $1B) companies. The side effect of this is skyrocketing housing prices in the traditional tech hubs. In response, many tech workers are deciding to move to lower cost locations such as Austin, Texas to buy a home[23]. According to the Economist, ​“between 2007 and 2016 a net 1m American residents ... left California for another state. Texas was the most popular destination”[22]​. Software Engineers contemplating a move from CA to TX would want a way to evaluate the cost benefit of relocation.
